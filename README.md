# Image Analysis Scripts in Jython for FIJI/ImageJ

This is a general purpose repository of Python language image analysis scripts for use in the Jython interpreter in FIJI/ImageJ. Where appropriate, I will also endeavor to included data analysis scripts in R. I will upload sets of things that will hopefully prove both user-friendly and generally useful to others. What is published here appears to work for my unique use-case, but may require some modifications or generalizations for other uses. Open to any pull requests with function extensions, enhancements, or optimizations.

## MIPS

These scripts are meant to be used to more rapidly generate maximum-intensity projections from Z-dimensional images. The __bulkMIPper.py__ file will take an input directory and perform maximum intensity projection on the entire directory of pattern-matched files. This will work best with a directory that only has the files of interest in it; however, bystander files are okay as long as they do not have the same file extension as the files of interest.

The __manMIPper.py__ is a convenience script that minimizes mouse clicks required to perform a maximum-intensity projection of custom top and bottom positions. Simply input the desired first and last slices and the macro will run and save the file in the original file directory. This is best if there are extraneous slices that reduce your final image quality or you would like to inspect the images prior to processing.

__fast_manMIPper.py__ is a lightweight implementation of __manMIPper.py__. Rather than requiring a library of already opened images, it processively opens them one at a time and queries user engagement prior to loading the subsequent image. This is great for low-memory settings. It also includes logic to check if the MIP already exists in the output folder and, if so, passes on to the next one. This may be the preferred method for most people, except in cases where image loading time is a greater bottleneck than memory itself.

__reSlicer.py__ is a Python translation of the built-in Slice Keeper and Slice Remover functions and can be called with _sliceKeeper(imp, first, last, inc)_ and _sliceRemover(imp, first, last, inc)_. The objective was to make these functions object-oriented and readily callable in a programmatic way. The hope is that this can simplify more precise logging by feeding first/last positions used to generate MIPs into a program that can then slice and save the Z positions used to generate the MIP while discarding less useful (out of focus, usually) data.

## Surface Plot

These scripts are built around the use of the [3D Surface Plot](https://github.com/fiji/Interactive_3D_Surface_Plot) plugin included in FIJI and ImageJ. Input was optimized for high-magnification images of individual cells. Both __autoIsolator.py__ and __manIsolator.py__ are meant to facilitate the pre-processing needed to input a set of images into the plugin. The objective is to use a generalist channel to create cellular outlines (something broadly present in the cytoplasm, for instance; in our instance, this was Î²-actin) and then use that as a mask for a more specific image you wish to interrogate (some more central or peripherally located protein). The mask is applied, the exterior of the mask is cleared, and the image is ready for input into the 3D Surface Plot plugin (which is not conducive to full automation if you need to manually find the maximum X dimension). The desired output from the 3D Surface Plot is a 2D plot of a cell along the longest X axis with Z in the Y direction (essentially a side-long or *horizon*tal view of the cell), smoothed to some consistent degree (we used 8.5, but any is acceptable with good rationale and consistent application), with axes removed and on a black background. This will allow for ready profiling in the downstream script (__surfacePlotMeasure.py__).

3D Surface Plot includes string parameters that allow for some automation; one could for instance place this script in a for loop to open all of the needed plots at once (depending on available memory and FIJI's handling of an arbitrary number of instances of 3D Surface Plot). However, the following code will open 3D Surface Plot with all the needed settings; use of the axes to guide the image into place and then turning them back off is extremely useful (switch drawAxes=0 to drawAxes=1).

```
from ij import IJ, ImagePlus

imp = IJ.getImage()
IJ.run(imp, "3D Surface Plot",
	'''plotType=1
	colorType=3
	drawAxes=0
	drawLines=0
	drawText=0
	grid=256
	drawLegend=0
	smooth=8.5
	backgroundColor=000000
	windowHeight=600
	windowWidth=720''')
```

__manSurfacePlotMeasure.py__ and __autoSurfacePlotMeasure.py__ take the 2D XZ images from 3D Surface Plot and captures all the bit-wise >0 points on the plot and saves them to a CSV file. It will do this for either an entire directory of images (perhaps best from __autoIsolator.py__) or individual images (__manIsolator.py__) and save the output to a .csv file. These .csv files can then be interpreted using the included __surface_plot_analsis.R__ script (although a Python interpretation is certainly possible).

surface_plot_analysis.R will take the directory of .csv files and process them to calculate area under the curve along the provided interval. This is useful for an application where you expect more central or distal distribution of a particular protein or other cellular feature. Other types of output and analysis are certainly possible from this data, although these have not yet been explored.

## Composites

One of the more click-intensive tasks in FIJI is the process of creating composite images from a set of individual color channels and these tools are meant as templates for implementing this logic in your own pipelines. They take folders of individual channels and then generate a LUT-keyed composite image from them. Some of the internal variables need to be edited in order to provide the results desired - for instance, the default merge is for 3 channels, but the function accepts up to 7 channels. I have, however, attempted to remove as much manual intervention as possible through string matching. One of the great things about ImageJ is the way it creates regularly patterned names for new files - the expected input for these scripts is the output of the "MIPS" scripts, but any set of channels will theoretically work with minor tweaking.

## Burden

These scripts are meant to facilitate analysis of _Mycobacterium marinum_ burden data from zebrafish larvae. One of the central challenges of the type of analysis the manual nature of having to draw circles around the larvae and avoiding inclusion of the autofluorescent yolk and any background signal. This facilitates removal of the yolk sac and other large sources of autofluorescence in the image. __burdenMeasurer.py__ is the primary function and should be installed as a FIJI program by addition to the active FIJI path (```import sys print(sys.path)``` in a Jython FIJI window). This will allow you to call burden() to run these measurements over entire directories of images (performance, while not completely optimized, turn this from a procedure taking many hours to one taking single-digit minutes). The arguments burden() takes are:

* (required) ```directory``` - a string with the file path to analyze
* (required) ```chan``` - an integer of the bacterial fluorescence channel
* (required) ```min_threshold``` - an integer of the empirically determined minimum threshold value that captures all the desired bacterial signal
* (required) ```ext``` - a string with the file extension for the images you wish to analyze
* (optional) ```screen_threshold``` - the automatic thresholding algorithm to use for identifying the yolk. "Otsu dark" is the default. "Try all dark" is a good option if you are unsure and will present a montage of all the threshold options for you to select from. Options are:
	* "None"
	* "Try all"
	* "Default dark"
	* "Huang dark"
	* "Intermodes dark"
	* "IsoData dark"
	* "IJ_IsoData dark"
	* "Li dark"
	* "MaxEntropy dark"
	* "Mean dark"
	* "MinError dark"
	* "Minimum dark"
	* "Moments dark"
	* "Otsu dark"
	* "Percentile dark"
	* "RenyiEntropy dark"
	* "Shanbhag dark"
	* "Triangle dark"
	* "Yen dark"
* (optional) ```proj_save``` - boolean for if you want to save the projections as they are created (strictly a time saver for later) Options: ```True``` or ```False```
* (optional) ```proj_show``` - boolean for showing the projections (```True```) or running silently in the background (```False```)
* (optional) ```imp_show``` - boolean for showing the original images
* (optional) ```fish_channel``` - an integer for the channel containing the whole fish if you wish to further mask measurements strictly to the fish
* (optional) ```outline_threshold``` - a string with one of the autothreshold algorithms for the fish outline
* (optional) ```brightfield``` - boolean for if the ```fish_channel``` is the brightfield channel
* (optional) ```subset``` - an integer for the number of images you wish to try (must be less than the total number in the directory)
* (optional) ```man_psize``` - an integer for the area size cut off for ```Analyze Particles...```. The default is pretty robust at 5x magnification, but larger (or smaller) values may be more appropriate. You can get an idea by running the threshold and measuring the yolk and using ~ the resulting area value (rounding down is good)

__custBurdenMeasure.py__ is a more manual, but slightly stripped down, (and thus more transparent) implementation of the same logic that allows you to alter various parameters. Not recommended for casual users, but worthwhile for more advanced users. Could be useful for troubleshooting some of the intermediate steps.

__burden_sorter.R__ is an R implementation of logic needed to calculate the percentiles for selecting "good" fish. You can change the parameters in various ways to make the cut offs more stringent/forgiving based on your use-case.

__mipOpener.py__ is a simple program to open all the images in a directory as MIPs. Sets the channel to the bacterial channel automatically (provide the integer in ```setC()```).
